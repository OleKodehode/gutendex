# Using the Gutendex API with React, vite & Tailwindcss

A webpage/app that utilizes the Gutendex API to fetch books.

---

- Fetches all the books to begin with
- Allows the user to browse by categories
- Allows the user to Search for specific books
- Allows the user to mark books as favorite and browse their favorites
- Should be somewhat responsive between mobile and desktop (tablets usually have big enough screens to go under as desktop nowadays)
